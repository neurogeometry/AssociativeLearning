# AssociativeLearning
These functions generate the replica theoretical and numerical results for the biologically constrained, single-neuron associative learning model described in the manuscript: Danke Zhang, Chi Zhang, and Armen Stepanyants, Robust associative learning is sufficient to explain structural and dynamical properties of local cortical circuits.  

The functions produces the results for both the associative and balanced models which include:
(1) excitatory and inhibitory inputs with sign-constrained weights
(2) l-1 norm constraint on input weights
(3) constant threshold

The functions work with MATLAB version R2017a or later.
